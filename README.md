## A personal fitness application

Jackboys is a fitness application that leverages AI to make meal preparation, exercise tracking, and calorie tracking easy.

There are four main features I wanted to implement within the application.

1. Weight measurement & tracking
2. Customized goals & exercises 
3. Daily calorie tracking
4. Meal Preparation with nutrition information

## Weight measurement & tracking

I wanted to provide a way for users to be able to enter and track their weight progress within the past week. Using a custom chart, users can easily track
their progress.


## Customized goals & exercises.

Once the account is first created, users can enter different fitness goals they wish to achieve. Based off of a user's specific information,
custom nutrition goals can be created using a scientific formula. Afterwards, users can track their daily meals & exercises and see if they are meeting 
said goals. I used generative AI as well to provide assistance with the exercise tracking.

## Daily Calorie Tracking 

I also wanted to provide users with the option to track their daily calorie intake and compare that against their goals. There are two ways to track 
calories. First is to use the defined meals that were created in a different feature or to search for specifc common ingredients and using those.
I utilized a food nutrition api to get nutrition information for different ingredients.

## Meal Preparation

Lastly, I wanted to provide a feature where users could use the common ingredients from the food API to create their own meals and track those as well. I also used AI to give assistance to users in their meal preparation.
